Yassir becomes the most valued startup in North Africa.\n\nAlgiers, November 7, 2022 – Yassir, an online marketplace offering on-demand services such as transportation, meal and grocery delivery, as well as financial services, announced today that it has raised $150 million in Series B funding from leading global investors. The investment was led by BOND, one of the largest venture capital firms in Silicon Valley, with participation from Y Combinator, the world's largest startup accelerator, DN Capital, Dorsal Capital, Quiet Capital, Stanford Alumni Ventures, and other existing strategic investors.\n\nHaving raised a total of $193.25 million over the five years since its launch, Yassir is now the most valued startup in North Africa and one of the most valued companies in Africa and the Middle East. With this latest funding round, Yassir plans to expand its reach in the region.\n\n\\\"Yassir means 'easy' in Arabic, and our mission as a company is to make people's lives easier,\\\" says Noureddine Tayebi, founder and CEO of Yassir. \\\"In the markets where we operate, we already have a significant impact on how people manage their daily lives. We look forward to expanding our presence in other geographical areas to become the first SuperApp to be widely adopted.\\\"\n\nFounded in 2017, the company is currently present in six countries and 45 cities, serving more than 8 million users. Popular in the Maghreb region (Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia) and in some parts of French-speaking Africa, Yassir provides three core services: transportation, meal and grocery delivery, and financial services. As an all-in-one ecosystem, Yassir offers its customers a unique solution to manage all their daily activities, from commuting to work to ordering groceries and meals. These services generate income for over 100,000 partners, including drivers, couriers, merchants, wholesalers, and other participants in the sharing economy.\n\nIn addition to providing a suite of basic services, Yassir offers financial services aimed at serving the entire ecosystem, addressing every component of the marketplace. A 2018 report by McKinsey \u0026 Company on the growth and innovation of financial services in Africa revealed that over half (57%) of the African population has no form of bank account. Among African banking customers, 40% prefer digital channels for transactions. By providing African consumers with a mobile payment solution as part of a more comprehensive service suite, Yassir addresses a significant market need, where 50% of the population already has access to mobile internet.\n\n\\\"We believe that technology will fundamentally reshape consumers' relationship with daily needs – transportation, food, financial services – not only in developed countries but in every corner of the world,\\\" said Daegwon Chae, General Partner at BOND. \\\"This investment is an extension of that belief in an underserved but dynamic and rapidly growing region. Emerging from North Africa, the app has already become essential to users for critical aspects of their lives.\\\"\n\nNoureddine, a Stanford Ph.D. holder and native of Algiers with over 10 years of experience in business and entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, returning to his native region, also commented on the company's mission.\n\n\\\"Yassir is not just a business for me. It was founded with a fourfold mission. First, we want to create a 100% locally successful technological startup model that will be emulated by others and especially by Yassir team members. Second, we want to empower local talent, especially technical talent that often leaves the region, mainly to Europe, for further studies or employment. In fact, we hire engineers in every country where we operate to extend this mission. Then, we want to make people's lives easy. In fact, Yassir means easy in Arabic! Finally, we want to instill social values through our products, such as trust and mutual assistance.\\\"\n\nTo learn more about Yassir, visit: https://yassir.com/.\n\n### About Yassir:\nFounded in 2017, Yassir is an online marketplace that offers its users a suite of services, including transportation, meal and grocery delivery, and payment services.

With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, restrictions were placed globally everywhere — from airports to retail outlets — forcing the adoption of digital commerce across multiple regions. As a result, Africans tuned in online and have not slowed down since. According to a global study by Mastercard conducted in 15 markets, consumers are increasingly moving away from cash and opting for contact-free and digital payment experiences — and they don’t expect to return. E-commerce is also seeing a surge, with Mastercard SpendingPulse reporting record growth rates across the globe as consumers increasingly shop online.\n\nAlthough initially focused on the Maghreb, Yassir started its expansion across other EMEA regions, and this came with an accompanying and exciting challenge — localizing digital payments per region, which, according to the World Economic Forum, 2018, is a determinant of the success or failure of e-commerce. This report documents the exciting challenges we faced, how we conquered the challenges, and how we are using the insights from this experience to shape novel innovations in different parts of Africa.\n\n**The Challenge** \n\nStrong dominance in the Maghreb region and tight government policies on financial services may have stifled the pace of digital innovation (e.g., card tokenization, server-to-server integrations, etc.), regardless of PCIDSS, SOC, or any other security/compliance standards. Issues such as this will naturally impact the creative boundaries of technical creatives; however, with Yassir, it was different, as the Payment team is armed with diversity. As with any startup, technical depth is often sacrificed for speed, but this was a good problem.\n\nWe had built a multi-currency payment orchestrator localized for each region, but we needed some time to observe product adoption, study usage patterns, and discover insights for optimizations and improvements. We noticed that in one of the markets — South Africa- Mastercard (MC) had more local dominance than Visa; ironically, MC debit cards had an unusual failure rate.\n\n![93% success rate in digital payment Blog.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_Blog_8b587bb9b8/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_Blog_8b587bb9b8.webp)\n\n_Fig 1: Comparative analysis of card processing networks adoption rate_\n\n\n**Problem Solving with Data**\n\nThis challenge was a good one, as it originated from a hybrid security and user experience update MC had just made to their infrastructure to protect merchants from chargeback fraud while provisioning a seamless user experience for merchants to optimize their systems for recurring payments/revenue. A new instruction type was instituted — eliminating the need for cardholders to tokenize every time they wanted to make a payment online.\n\nAnalyzing the transactions revealed a format code 800.100.156 for unsuccessful transactions, unique to MC cards. This happened as a result of failed authentication when a customer wanted to make a payment. However, on discussing with our providers, we discovered a mandate requiring merchants to set their standingInstruction.type to UNSCHEDULED and point initial transactions to Customer initiated transaction (CIT) type, enabling first-time card users to authenticate but returning card not to, using the Merchant initiated transaction (MIT) type to by-pass auth enforcement.\n\n![93% success rate in digital payment.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_7576201d82/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_7576201d82.webp)\n\n_Fig 2: Analysis of error codes_\n\nThe concept of 3D secure authentication is one of the paradoxes of the payment processing industry, because if authentication is not enforced, it makes the card acquirer vulnerable to chargeback fraud. However, it is enforced for every transaction, it can reduce the success rate of payments by up to 40%. Finding a balance will always be a no-brainer, and Payment processing leaders such as Bolt who have succeeded at creating a seamless UX balance at scale, boast of increasing conversion rate by up to 70%.\n\n**Business Outcome**\n\nLike a Domino effect, solving this problem solved two other associated problems over time, such as risk management timeout and user authentication failure with format errors 100.380.501 and 100.380.401, respectively.\n\nAfter deploying all the solutions, we observed a ~94% success rate for every unique customer who tried to make a payment and 84% success rate for unique transactions.\n\n![93% success rate in digital payment 2.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_2_ce95de9260/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_2_ce95de9260.webp)\n\n_Fig 3: Analysis of change in success/failure rate_\n\nThis is a noteworthy milestone because it puts Yassir’s payment on par with global industry giants that have been in the domain for decades.\n\nA post-mortem call with the provider revealed that this was the highest possible result achievable and top 1% by industry standard, and internal data was sufficient to validate their claim. In the payment space, It is impossible to achieve a 100% success rate because of scenarios such as insufficient funds, issuer declining transactions, the amount exceeding credit, canceled by users, amongst others, which are also an important part of the payment lifecycle, which reveals the activities/behavior of the entire ecosystem — from the issuing bank to the providers, the infrastructure partners, the integrators and finally, the end users being served.\n\n![93% success rate in digital payment 3.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_3_0311cf587d/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_3_0311cf587d.webp)\n\nFig 4: analysis of unsuccessful transactions\n\n**What This Means for the Rest of Africa**\n\nSometimes, innovation can mean creating something completely new; other times, it can mean discovering something novel and expanding it into a region where it does not exist, and this has been the case for us. Inspired by this Journey, we have moved beyond just standardizing our payment designs to auditing and co-designing the payment experience of payment partners in other parts of Africa to create a seamless yet secure payment experience for our customers in parts of the Maghreb region and West Africa, giving Yassir an opportunity to frontier innovation in the payment industry across the EMEA region.\n\nAchieving this milestone is significant as it creates trust, which is necessary for individuals to add and, in fact, save their credit card details on e-commerce solutions. It allows the insights gained from this experience to be replicated in other EMEA regions with notoriously low adoption of digital payment — unlocking these regions for complete digital commerce while becoming a leader in payment orchestration. We believe that this is just day \n\n**Acknowledgement:**\n\nBoipelo.M, Yousra.H, Amadou.B, Marho.O, Mehdi.A, Xiaoxi.Z \u0026 Other members of the payment processing team.","createdAt":"2024-09-15T09:44:31.124Z","featuredImage":{"__typename":"UploadFileEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"UploadFile","name":"93% success rate in digital payment.webp","height":564,"width":1400,"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_7576201d82/93_success_rate_in_digital_payment_7576201d82.webp"}},"tags":{"__typename":"TagRelationResponseCollection","data":[{"__typename":"Tag","id":"13","name":"Digital Payments"},{"__typename":"Tag","id":"25","name":"Innovation"},{"__typename":"Tag","id":"12","name":"Software Trends"}]}},{"__typename":"BlogArticle","id":"4","title":"From Collaboration to System: The Birth of SEFAR","locale":"en","subtitle":null,"slug":"from-collaboration-to-system-the-birth-of-sefar","publishedAt":"2024-10-22T16:44:04.946Z","publishingDate":"2024-04-23T00:00:00.000Z","author":"Dimitrios Arapis - Head of Product Design \u0026 User Experience","content":"Our journey began as a small team with a big challenge: merging ride-hailing, delivery, and financial services into a single, powerful SuperApp. Existing apps functioned independently, relying on a basic UI kit that lacked customization and scalability. Fixing it wasn’t an option.\n\n\nOur first dilemma: build or buy a design system? Buying wouldn’t provide the understanding needed for long-term success. Off-the-shelf systems lacked the specialization, character, and accessibility we needed. Additionally, vendor lock-in and limited RTL (right-to-left) UI support were important concerns, especially for an application that mainly operates in Arab countries.\n\n**The Challenge: Building a Foundation for the Future**\n\nCreating a SuperApp that covers multiple user needs meant crafting a design system from the ground up. We embarked on a deep exploration of color palettes, meticulously balancing weight and harmony while prioritizing accessibility from the very beginning. This included tokenizing our color system for easy adaptation during a planned rebranding project.\n\nTypography presented another hurdle. Most Latin fonts lack support for Arabic characters. We meticulously matched the look and feel, ensuring consistent baselines and weights across both alphabets to deliver a seamless reading experience for all users.\n\nBut the challenges didn’t stop there. Building bidirectional and responsive UI components for right-to-left (RTL) interfaces proved particularly complex. We tackled everything from simple elements to intricate layouts, ensuring all components functioned flawlessly regardless of language direction. We’ll delve deeper into these specific challenges in future articles.\n\n\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_d80a245607/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_d80a245607.webp\"\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n*Test*\n\n**Fostering Collaboration: Building SEFAR Together**\n\nGiven the challenge’s nature and our team’s size, we decided to approach it with a collaborative spirit. Eight passionate designers from various product domains volunteered their expertise to form the core SEFAR team. Their diverse perspectives ensured the system catered to the needs of all our products.\n\nBuilding a successful design system requires robust governance. We established a comprehensive set of processes encompassing every step of the development lifecycle:\n\n- **Discovery**: We hosted collaborative workshops that fueled our initial design decisions, for component usage across domains.\n- **Delivery**: A well-defined workflow that ensured efficient component creation and library maintenance.\n- **Review**: We embraced the 4-to-8-eye principle for both design peer review and developer handoff review to foster open communication and ensure craft quality.\n- **Handoff \u0026 Versioning**: Clear handoff procedures and a version control system maintained consistency and facilitated collaboration across teams.\n- **Bug Reporting \u0026 Support**: Efficient bug reporting processes and ongoing support addressed issues promptly.\n\nOur vision for SEFAR resonated with the business. Recognizing its long-term benefits, they provided critical support by allocating eight developers from different platforms (iOS, Android, Web) to work alongside the design team. This collaborative, cross-functional approach ensured the seamless integration of SEFAR into our development workflows.\n\nThis combined section emphasizes the collaborative spirit, details the established governance processes, and highlights the crucial buy-in from the business for developer support.\n\n![The Birth of SEFAR 2.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_2_56528f0ae6/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_2_56528f0ae6.webp)\n\n**SEFAR: A Symphony of Design Disciplines**\n\nSEFAR transcends the boundaries of a typical UI component library. It functions as a comprehensive “System of Systems,” harmonizing various design disciplines to create a cohesive user experience. Here’s how each element contributes to the symphony:\n\n- **Design**: SEFAR’s core offering lies in its vast library of pre-built, reusable UI components. The majority of these components are opinionated, therefore encompassing behavior and business logic, to ensure consistent, efficient, and scalable behavior across all product domains without being over-generalized. These components are then used to form domain-specific Patterns, where a core component is properly adjusted, within a range of given out-of-box preferences, to address each domain’s needs\n- **Illustration**: Visual communication plays a vital role in user experience. SEFAR boasts a rich library of over 200 illustrations, empowering designers to enhance interfaces and engage users. The potential for a future illustration system is also under exploration, offering an even more streamlined approach to visual storytelling.\n- **UX Writing**: Clear and consistent user communication is paramount. SEFAR champions multilingual UX writing (English, French, Arabic + dialects), ensuring a seamless user experience across different languages. Features like live integration with Lokalise, a translation management platform, further streamline the localization process.\n\nBy integrating these UX disciplines, SEFAR creates a unified design language that fosters a consistent and positive experience for users, regardless of their product or language preference. This holistic approach positions SEFAR as a powerful tool for driving user engagement and brand recognition.\n\n![The Birth of SEFAR 3.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_3_cc8b6a9687/The_Birth_of_SEFAR_3_cc8b6a9687.webp)\n\n**Conclusion: A Collaborative Triumph and A Look Ahead**\n\nSEFAR’s journey is a testament to the power of collaboration. Recognizing the need for a unified design language, a passionate team of designers and developers came together, fueled by a shared vision. We didn’t just build a design system; we created a collaborative environment that went beyond departmental boundaries.

We also delve into how Platform Engineering benefits such services by encouraging automated infrastructure provisioning, enhanced observability and monitoring, enforced security practices, and finally scalability and resilience.\n\n**Platform Engineering; A fresh air**\n\nPlatform Engineering is a discipline that focuses on building tools that combine automated infrastructure and self-service capabilities to provide developers the ability to create apps using standardized frameworks, instead of starting from scratch. Platform engineering aims to create Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) that abstract the underlying complexities of infrastructure, enabling developers to focus on delivering value, without being experts in infrastructure thereby improving software delivery, reducing toil, and increasing operational efficiency.\n\n\nAccording to the State of Platform Engineering Vol 2, when developers focus on writing code completely, organizations can slash Time To Market (TTM) by 30%, achieve 4x higher deployment frequency and accelerate lead time by 30%.\n\n**How we transform Developer Experience and Cloud Operations with Platform Engineering at Yassir**\n\nAt Yassir, we are committed to leveraging cutting-edge tools and practices to deliver innovative services and solutions. We rely on tenets of Platform Engineering to bridge the gap between DevOps practice and the Software Development Cycle, enabling our engineers to deploy faster, easier, and without much friction. One of the cornerstones of platform engineering at Yassir is the use of the CDKTF library for designing infrastructure. This library allows our developers to review software in a relatable programming language without the hassle of having to learn Terraform or understand its syntax.\n\n![Platform Engineering 2.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/Platform_Engineering_2_d1c23b9408/Platform_Engineering_2_d1c23b9408.webp)\n\nAt Yassir, we are focused on the right developer tooling to allow us ship products faster and deploy new releases seamlessly. We make use of an open-source platform called backstage as our Internal Developer Platform(IDP) to encourage collaboration between teams, squads and domains. In addition to backstage, we use another open-source tool called Apache Devlake for our core DORAmetrics. We use Devlake to measure deployment frequency, change failure rate and other necessary metrics that enhance observability.\n\n![Platform Engineering 3.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/Platform_Engineering_3_21dd49a2d9/Platform_Engineering_3_21dd49a2d9.webp)\n\nSecurity is a major concern at Yassir, we employ the use of standard security practices in the use of HashiCorp Vault for secrets management and SonarQube for continuous vulnerability scanning and static code analysis. We integrate these security tools into our CI/CD pipelines, automatically scanning for vulnerabilities and bugs. We also utilize PagerDuty, to ensure the highest reliability and availability of our services. We use pager duty for incident response to automate escalations and manage our incident response systems.\n\nWith the strategic implementation of the afore-mentioned services and tools, Yassir has completely transformed its developer experience and Cloud Operations, making it easier to abstract complexity, automate process and build software securely from start to finish.\n\n**Introducing Platform Engineering to your organization**\n\n![Platform Engineering 4.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/Platform_Engineering_4_80b8997fe0/Platform_Engineering_4_80b8997fe0.webp)\n\nIntroducing platform engineering to your organization should be an iterative process that requires careful planning and continuous improvement. The goal is to build a self-service platform, encourage its adoption then initiate a culture switch to the self-service orientation. The following steps are quick steps ways to achieve this:\n\n- Assess the current state and define the objectives of your migration to Platform engineering.\n- Gain Executive support and align stakeholders.\n- Establish your first Platform Team.\n- Develop a Platform Strategy.\n- Implement a pilot project.\n- Document your findings and iterate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPlatform engineering is leveraging cloud-native technologies to redefine how software is deployed and improve the collaboration between Software engineering and Infrastructure. Also, by abstracting layers of infrastructure into modules and APIs, Platform engineering is improving developer autonomy and embedding best practices into the software deployment process.

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting framework used by organizations and individuals to define and measure their objectives. Objectives are qualitative, aspirational goals, while Key Results are specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress. This approach fosters alignment and transparency at various levels within an organization, from company-wide goals to team contributions. Regular check-ins ensure focus and adaptability, creating a dynamic system for achieving and celebrating success. OKRs promote **transparency, collaboration, alignment and agility in goal pursuit.**\n\nAs we entered a hypergrowth phase, it became urgent to adopt an intentional way to set and track goals. We use OKR to focus on the right direction (Do the right things), align on the right things (Do things right) and making fast decisions autonomously (Do things fast).\n\n**Starting with the Why**\n\nWhen coaching on OKRs, I often notice individuals start setting their OKRs (Objective and key results) by discussing tasks, action plans and initiatives. Few can easily connect these solutions with outcomes, and even fewer can explain why they engage in those initiatives in the first place.\n\nIf this resonates with you, know that many share the same experience. In his **Golden Circle** theory, Simon Sinek explained how we are programmed to communicate. We’re used to expressing **WHAT** we do instead of **WHY** we do things. Moreover, we spend much time discussing solutions like products, services, and ideas (outputs), neglecting the reasons behind these solutions. \n\nSimon mentioned that leading companies communicate from the inside-out, starting with why they exist, then how they function, and finally, what they do.\nThe field of Neuroscience highlights the importance of always starting your message by stating your purpose. When presenting your WHY, you activate the part of the brain that activates behaviors — Prefrontal Cortex.\n\nStarting with the why helps us uncover the true purpose and objectives of a task. This in turn, might transform how we motivate people to pursue more meaningful goals towards making Africans’ lives easier than just “developing a new feature”.\n\n**Objective \u0026 Key Results — Real-life example**\n\nWhen I guide Product and Tech teams at Yassir in setting significant objectives and Key Results, I often ask them if “losing weight” is considered an Objective or a Key Result.\n\nGenerally, individuals respond by identifying it as an objective. The reason for this is, as humans, we usually perceive goals like “Getting in shape, losing a few pounds, gaining muscles…etc” as more tangible and measurable.\n\nFollowing that, I ask another question **“Why would someone try to lose weight?”** Responses come in like this:\n\n- To play around with their kids without feeling tired\n- To lace their shoes without struggling\n- To increase their self-esteem\n- To have better health and live longer\n\nSetting goals focused only on gaining muscles and losing weight may not be that inspiring after a while and would likely lead to giving up in the middle of the journey. However, when we design our metrics to be focused on deeper reasons behind the goal, we send a strong message to our brain: “It is important to keep going to the gym because we are tired of not being able to lace our shoes properly”.\n\n**Setting OKRs using the Golden Circle model**\n\nTo stimulate the part of the brain that controls behaviors, we can take inspiration from the Golden Circle model, starting with the objective instead of the key results or tasks. This involves:\n\n1. The clarity of our objective (WHY)\n2. The discipline of tracking our key results (HOW)\n3. The consistency of what we are doing to reach it (WHAT)\n\n![OKR 2.webp](https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/OKR_2_4e6b1d1fac/OKR_2_4e6b1d1fac.webp)\n\nReturning to the example of getting in shape and setting a personal OKR by using the same approach above, we might have:\n\n**Objective: Become healthier than ever to be able to play with my kids**\n\n- KR1: _Lose weight from 85 kg to 80 kg_\n- KR2: _Decrease my body fat percentage from 27% to 22%_\n- KR3: _Reduce my waist circumference from 104 cm to 94 cm_\n\n**Objective: Enhance my running performance to complete Berlin’s Ultramarathon**\n\n- KR1: _Achieve an average pace of 5:30’’/km during training._\n- KR2: _Lose weight from 75 kg to 72kg_\n- KR3: _Increase my VO² max from 65 to 75 mL/kg/min_\n\nBoth examples share the goal of losing weight, but their action plans (tasks) may vary based on the underlying context (reason). Someone aiming to shed pounds for better health might establish tasks like reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake, whereas an individual focused on improving running performance may set goals such as increasing exercise frequency or hiring a professional coach. The crucial factor is must align our initiatives with the underlying motivation (WHY); failure to do so may lead us in the wrong direction.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nMany teams struggle with OKR implementations due to the inability to change how they work. While new frameworks or tools can help, changing the way we approach our goals and tasks can make significant improvements in our work results. What I learned at Yassir is that prioritizing purpose in setting OKRs proved to be effective. Having a narrative that mobilizes and a clear and detailed reason simplifies tasks and makes them more straightforward toward the goal.\n\nAs the OKR framework continues to gain prominence in the start-up world, OKR practitioners and champions are asked to be outstanding storytellers who can articulate a compelling vision for why we do what we do (be it losing weight or otherwise).\n","createdAt":"2024-09-15T15:29:43.667Z","featuredImage":{"__typename":"UploadFileEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"UploadFile","name":"OKR 2.webp","height":420,"width":1055,"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/OKR_2_4e6b1d1fac/OKR_2_4e6b1d1fac.webp"}},"tags":{"__typename":"TagRelationResponseCollection","data":[{"__typename":"Tag","id":"26","name":"Agility"},{"__typename":"Tag","id":"19","name":"OKRs"}]}},{"__typename":"BlogArticle","id":"7","title":"Driving Engineering Performance the Yassir Way","locale":"en","subtitle":null,"slug":"driving-engineering-performance-the-yassir-way","publishedAt":"2024-10-25T16:53:29.850Z","publishingDate":"2023-12-07T23:00:00.000Z","author":"Yassir Product \u0026 Tech","content":"As tech teams grow, every executive would like to know whether they are still (high-) performing. McKinsey, Gartner, and some industry luminaries all came up with their own answers, but as every company is different, we felt there was always something missing in what was out there.\n\nWe pondered a lot about developer productivity and performance. We have built our own framework which has shown good results so far. In this post, I will summarise the core pillars we rely on for measuring and driving engineering performance. If you are on a similar path of hyper-scale, this could serve as a good starting point for you to adapt and improve.\n\n**Our performance framework relies on 4 pillars:**\n\n1.  **Company OKR to set the direction and provide alignment**\n\nWe use the OKR Framework to define and communicate what the teams need to achieve during a set period. Objectives are shared amongst product and tech teams. Each team inherits a set of ambitious OKRs that include business outcomes as well as engineering performance goals. These objectives are also co-created with the teams.\n\nThe most important engineering objectives that we share are:\n- **Velocity**: how fast we can deliver stuff\n- **Quality \u0026 Reliability**: how stable and defect-free our services are\n\nOKRs are a great way to ensure smooth execution and build a culture of accountability. The co-creation elements help strengthen ownership. The shared nature of the OKRs provides the required focus.\n\nWe tend to overshare and over-communicate about our OKRs internally. Reminding the teams on every occasion about the objectives and overall progress.\n\n2. **Key metrics and targets to measure progress**\n\nOnce you have your objectives, you need to define the target key results to achieve. We figured there are three categories of metrics that are important for us:\n\na) **Lag metrics to define what success looks like**\n\nIn our case, each objective described above will come with 3–4 key results. We rely on DORA Metrics to set the targets as well as a home-grown “reliability score” and Tech Debt Index.\n\nFrom one quarter to another, we might include additional key results that are usually aligned with some target benchmarks. These “Lag Metrics” (i.e. metrics that show the outcomes) are great to align teams and offer them a clear definition of success they can strive to reach.\n\nb) **Lead metrics to foster the conditions of success**\n\nWe noticed providing a clear idea of where we want to go is not enough to achieve high performance. We need, at the same time, to enable the conditions and environment for high performance. We achieve this by tracking “lead metrics” (i.e. input-based metrics that show what is being done). Here, our focus is on two areas:\n\n- **Team Composition**: we have strong views on what a high-performing team looks like, from the team size (smaller teams tend to perform better), the skills it contains (cross-functional teams tend to perform better), or the level of seniority. We call this the Yassir SAUCE. We track how each team fares on this team composition index and strive to get all teams to perfection.\n- **Capacity Allocation**: we monitor our engineering efforts spent and ensure that a certain level is dedicated to maintenance and tech improvement (vs building new capabilities), sprint over sprint.\n\nc) **Sentiment Analysis for Reality Check**\n\nWe can spend a lot of time in Excel sheets tweaking the best formula for high-performing teams, but nothing replaces the unfiltered feedback of the front-line teams to inform on how well we are doing. A solid performance framework should also make space for the voice of the engineers.\n\nWe run several surveys throughout the year to capture this voice. Employee NPS score is a critical metric for us. We also measure psychological safety, developer satisfaction, and our agile maturity regularly. This feedback helps us calibrate our interventions and identify gaps that would otherwise go unnoticed.\n\n3. ** Tech Roadmap to ensure execution**\n\nOnce we have goals and targets, we can layer in initiatives that enable us to move the needle. Initiatives are organised into a technical roadmap that lives alongside our product roadmap and includes activities such as tech debt management, platform improvements, etc. We also hold demo days and architecture reviews to check on progress and offer a forum for discussion and feedback. We tend to invest 20–30% of our capacity into the tech roadmap each quarter.\n\nHaving a plan and a cadence to review progress helps us strengthen our execution muscle and hold a high standard of accountability.\n\n\n4. **Continuous monitoring of individual performance to foster growth \u0026 development**\n\nThe last bit of the framework is about individual performance. Performance reviews are a powerful tool to shape certain behaviors and identify and grow your top performers. You will need a standardized career framework that clarifies the expectations for each role and what is needed to move to the next level. At Yassir, every engineer is evaluated against 4 broad behaviors that reflect our performance expectations as well as our values. Crucially, we decouple individual performance from OKR execution.\n\nWe recommend running bi-annual performance reviews instead of just once a year. That helps capture a more accurate picture. In fact, performance reviews should not be limited to once or twice a year, we encourage all our managers to run 1:1 meetings with their subordinates to provide/receive feedback constantly. We find that type of direct communication to be the number #1 productivity booster.\n\n**Wrapping up**\n\nTo summarise, hundreds of models for measuring engineering performance exist. Choose the one that suits your environment, as no two companies are similar. Ours, built through trial and error and observing thousands of developer hours, relies on four key pillars:\n\n- **Company objectives**: shared across product and tech teams that cover velocity and quality\n- **Key metrics **and ambitious targets that inform about outcomes, key activities, and developer sentiment progress\n- **Tech roadmap**: that highlights what needs to be done by whom\n- **Individual performance**: that links company performance objectives and expectations to individual career goals and growth plans\n\n\nThis framework has been instrumental in overhauling Yassir tech capabilities. We’ve seen substantial improvement across our lead time for change (-30%), deployment frequency (+100%), and Mean time to Restore (-90%) as well as developer satisfaction (as measured by eNPS).\n\n\nThe key is to combine the right mix of metrics (aligned with your business goals) with a solid discipline of execution and excellence. In doing so, one should not rely on metrics solely or too eagerly as it will most certainly fail. Neither should you overlook basic HR hygiene (competitive pay, work conditions, etc) or your team’s motivation and well-being. It’s a system and for it to work, you will need to find the right balance.\n\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to start somewhere. As long as your high-performance expectations are clear and shared by everyone, you are on the right path. Perhaps, one of the biggest risks with such an endeavor is to over-engineer it and, in doing so, get distracted and lose focus over the business. High performance makes sense, if and only if it enables us to serve our customers better.\n\n","createdAt":"2024-09-15T15:41:09.603Z","featuredImage":{"__typename":"UploadFileEntityResponse","data":{"__typename":"UploadFile","name":"Driving Engineering Performance  1.webp","height":1026,"width":960,"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/cms-strapi-bucket-stg/Driving_Engineering_Performance_1_2ed8b8e16d/Driving_Engineering_Performance_1_2ed8b8e16d.webp"}},"tags":{"__typename":"TagRelationResponseCollection","data":[{"__typename":"Tag","id":"26","name":"Agility"},{"__typename":"Tag","id":"23","name":"Performance "},{"__typename":"Tag","id":"12","name":"Software Trends"}]}}],"tags":[{"__typename":"Tag","name":"News","id":"34"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Blog","id":"35"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Design System","id":"36"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Sefar","id":"37"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Product \u0026 Tech","id":"38"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Innovation","id":"40"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Africa","id":"41"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"African Talent","id":"42"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Agility","id":"43"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"AI","id":"44"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Cloud Technologies","id":"45"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Company Culture","id":"46"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Diversity","id":"47"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Digital Payments","id":"48"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Entrepreneurship ","id":"49"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Ethical AI","id":"50"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Global Team","id":"51"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Growth","id":"52"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"In-app Chat","id":"53"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Metrics","id":"54"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"OKRs","id":"55"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Performance ","id":"56"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Platform Engineering","id":"57"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Software Trends","id":"58"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Startup life","id":"59"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"System Design","id":"60"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Tech Roadmap","id":"61"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Women in Tech","id":"62"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Yassir ","id":"63"},{"__typename":"Tag","name":"Yassir Cairo","id":"64"}]},"newsArticles":{"articles":[{"__typename":"NewsArticle","id":"51","title":"The Paris Saint-Germain and Yassir have signed a global partnership.

Emerging from North Africa, the app has already become essential to users for critical aspects of their lives.\\\"\n\nNoureddine, a Stanford Ph.D. holder and native of Algiers with over 10 years of experience in business and entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, returning to his native region, also commented on the company's mission.\n\n\\\"Yassir is not just a business for me. It was founded with a fourfold mission. First, we want to create a 100% locally successful technological startup model that will be emulated by others and especially by Yassir team members. Second, we want to empower local talent, especially technical talent that often leaves the region, mainly to Europe, for further studies or employment.
